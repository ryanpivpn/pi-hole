/etc/dnsmasq.d/01-pihole.conf: the config specific to Pi-hole that controls how dnsmasq functions

/etc/dnsmasq.d/02-pihole-dhcp.conf: the config file used when Pi-hole's DHCP server is active

/etc/dnsmasq.d/03-pihole-wildcard.conf: used for wildcard blacklisting




/etc/pihole/

/etc/pihole/adlists.default: the list of URLs where the block lists are sourced from

/etc/pihole/adlists.list: a custom user-defined list of URLs to source just like adlists.default. If created it will override adlists.default, but by default it does not exist until the user creates it.

/etc/pihole/blacklist.txt: a user-defined list of additional domains to block52

gravity.list: perhaps Pi-hole's most important file--it is a hosts file with all of the domains that are being blocked

install.log: a log file generated during installation

list.n.domain: these are the raw lists that are downloaded. You may have several others depending whether or not you use additional block lists

local.list: this contains local list entries such as pi.hole so you can access the Web interface via name instead of IP.

logrotate: this is the config file that controls how logrotate handles flushing the log file

/etc/pihole/setupVars.conf: this file contains variables needed to effectively setup and configure Pi-hole

/etc/pihole/whitelist.txt: a user-defined list of domains to be whitelisted19. Pi-hole does generate this file during installation as it adds the domains that host the lists so they are not inadvertently blocked
